# dotfiles

This is what my i3 looks like
![Alt Text](https://raw.github.com/KostasKyriakou/dotfiles/master/i3wm.png)

# neovim config
Neovim config based on coc.nvim and good support for languages like C and rust. Also, vimwiki is there because it's great.

# zsh config
Zsh config based on oh-my-zsh. Includes plugins like autojump, syntax-highlight and git and aliases I find useful and you may do so too.

# i3 config
Config is always under construction.

# polybar config
Quite simple bar.(screenshot above)

# rofi config
Also simple rofi config much like pressing mod in many DEs.

# alacritty config
Beware the font size. Google Dark theme.

# vifm config
Not much to see here.

# dunst config
Nothing to see here.

# Copying everything to your home
You can simply `make put` and everything will be put in its rightful place.
If you want to copy a specific config you should use `make {nvimp, i3p, rofip, polyp, alacrittyp, zshp, vifmp, dunstp}` (eg. `make nvimp`).
