## neovim config
Neovim config based on `nvim_lsp` and good support for languages like C/C++ and rust. Also, vimwiki is there because it's great.

Note:Requires [neovim nightly](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly).

## zsh config
Zsh config based on oh-my-zsh. Includes plugins like `autojump`, `syntax-highlight` and aliases I find useful and you may do so too.
